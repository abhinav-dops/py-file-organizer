# File Organizer

## Overview

The File Organizer is a Python-based utility that helps users automatically organize files in a specified directory by their file types. It sorts files into folders based on their extensions (e.g., `.pdf`, `.png`, `.txt`, etc.) and provides features such as undo functionality, logging, and organization by date.

## Features

- Automatically moves files into categorized folders
- Logs all actions for audit and rollback
- Undo option to reverse the last operation
- Organize files by type or by modification date
- Easy to configure and extend

## Folder Structure

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OS: Windows, Linux, or macOS

No external packages are required. The script uses Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries (`os`, `shutil`, `datetime`, and `logging`).
